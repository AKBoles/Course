## Regression

A Machine Learning Approach. This course focuses regression, one of the most important types of data analysis, with a wide range of applications. After successfully completing this course, you will be able to use regression methods in practice, implement some of the most fundamental algorithms in this area, and choose the right model for your task. In addition, you will become proficient in core ML concepts that transcend regression settings: you will understand the practical implications of fundamental ML concepts, such as the bias-variance tradeoff, key ML data analysis techniques, such as cross validation, and the most important optimization techniques used to learn ML models, gradient descent and coordinate descent.
