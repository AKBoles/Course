# Regression

This class focuses on regression, one of the most important types of Machine Learning, with a wide range of applications. After successfully completion of this class, you should be able to use regression methods in practice, implement some of the most fundamental algorithms in this area. 

In addition, you will become proficient in core ML concepts that transcend regression settings: you will understand the practical implications of fundamental ML concepts, such as the bias-variance tradeoff, key ML data analysis techniques, such as cross validation, and the most important optimization techniques used to learn ML models, gradient descent and coordinate descent.

## Programming Language: Python
We encourage the use the IPython Notebook in our assignments. The IPython Notebook is a simple interactive environment for programming with Python, which makes it really easy to share your results. Think about it as a combination of a Python terminal and a wiki page. Thus, you can combine code, plots and text to explain what you did. 

You are required to use IPython Notebook in the assignments.
