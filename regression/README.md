# Regression

This class focuses on regression, one of the most important types of Machine Learning, with a wide range of applications. After successfully completion of this class, you should be able to use regression methods in practice, implement some of the most fundamental algorithms in this area. 

In addition, you will become proficient in core ML concepts that transcend regression settings: you will understand the practical implications of fundamental ML concepts, such as the bias-variance tradeoff, key ML data analysis techniques, such as cross validation, and the most important optimization techniques used to learn ML models, gradient descent and coordinate descent.

## Programming Language: Python
We encourage the use the IPython Notebook in our assignments. The IPython Notebook is a simple interactive environment for programming with Python, which makes it really easy to share your results. Think about it as a combination of a Python terminal and a wiki page. Thus, you can combine code, plots and text to explain what you did. 

You are required to use IPython Notebook in the assignments.

Python Libraries

Although you will be implementing algorithms from scratch in various assignments, some software tools will be useful in the process. In particular, there are four types of data tools that would be helpful:

Data manipulation: to help you slice-and-dice the data, create new features, and clean the data.
Matrix operations: in the inner loops of your algorithms, you will do various matrix operations, and libraries focus on these will speed-up your code significantly.
Plotting library: so you can visualize data and models.
Pre-implemented ML algorithms: in some assignments where we are focusing on fundamental ML concepts, such as cross-validation or the bias-variance tradeoff, you will use a pre-implemented ML algorithms to help focus your efforts on the fundamentals.
