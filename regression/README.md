# Regression

This class focuses on regression, one of the most important types of Machine Learning, with a wide range of applications. After successfully completion of this class, you should be able to use regression methods in practice, implement some of the most fundamental algorithms in this area. 

In addition, you will become proficient in core ML concepts that transcend regression settings: you will understand the practical implications of fundamental ML concepts, such as the bias-variance tradeoff, key ML data analysis techniques, such as cross validation, and the most important optimization techniques used to learn ML models, gradient descent and coordinate descent.
